# Platform notes

This file is our living season log and platform journal.
Update it whenever we make architecture decisions, discover API quirks, or
capture season-specific tradeoffs.

## Purpose

- Track what the platform is doing now versus what Fantrax is doing.
- Record design decisions that matter for next season.
- Capture unresolved questions, blockers, and follow-up work.
- Keep a shared source of truth for engineering notes.

## Current season summary

- Start date: 5 Aug 2026.
- Season target: support the 16-user Fantrax league from GW6 onwards.
- A dummy league carries GW1–GW5. It is drafted early and deliberately small, so
  the roster, lineup and join surfaces get five gameweeks of real football to be
  refined against before the real league drafts. GW1 is not a ship date.
- Fantrax remains authoritative for live scoring and league state.
- We are building the platform layer separately so the UI and football data can
  survive provider changes.

## Current priorities

- Keep `packages/core` clean: adapters, maps, scoring, identity.
- Keep `apps/companion` focused on the live app experience.
- Keep `apps/lab` as the future 27/28 prototype.
- Avoid building a server-side Fantrax login unless the extension/cookie flow is
  solved.

## Known constraints

- Fantrax auth is gated by reCAPTCHA + 2FA and cannot be migrated to a standard
  password flow.
- FPL player `code` is stable; FPL player `id` is season-scoped.
- Fantrax sport code for EPL is `EPL`, not `SOCCER`.

## Verified Fantrax facts (probed live 5 Aug 2026)

League id `ayyoh3n2mr326v2o`. Everything below is from real responses, not docs.

**Errors arrive as HTTP 200.** The failure is in the body:
`{"error":{"onScreen":bool,"code":string,"message":string}}`. `res.ok` is useless
here — the FPL client's `if (!res.ok) throw` would sail straight past every one of
them. Codes seen so far: `WARNING`, `INVALID_LEAGUE_ID`, `NO_TEAMS`, `NO_LEAGUE`.
The vocabulary is undocumented and inconsistent (the same missing-leagueId
condition returns `WARNING` from some methods and `INVALID_LEAGUE_ID` from
others), so we branch on the envelope's presence, never on a specific code.

**The league is empty until the draft.** `getTeamRosters` answers `NO_TEAMS`,
`getStandings` is `[]`, `getDraftResults` is `{draftPicks: [], draftState:
"running"}`. Their element shapes had therefore never been observed and were
typed `unknown` rather than invented — until 6 Aug, below.

**`getLeagueInfo` is populated now**, and carries: 38 scoring and roster periods
aligned to FPL gameweeks (period 1 opens 21 Aug), roster limits 14 total / 11
active / 3 reserve with position caps G1 D5 M5 F3, snake draft, the full scoring
system, and a 699-entry `playerInfo` map. Timestamps carry a `-0400` (US Eastern)
offset while `startDate`/`endDate` are plain dates — do not mix them.

**`getPlayerIds?sport=EPL`** needs no leagueId and returns 759 entries (758 on
5 Aug — the pool moves), of which **60 are not players**: synthetic per-club
entities (`Tm`, `TmOF`, `TmG`) whose `fantraxId` contains `#`. Filter them out or
they reach the identity bridge and match a club by name. `rotowireId` is on 544
of the 699 real players (78%; the 71% figure that was in `CLAUDE.md` divided by
all 759 entries, team entities included). **`sportRadarId` does not appear on this
endpoint at all.**

**Club codes differ from FPL on exactly two of twenty:** Fantrax `BRF`/`NOT`
versus FPL `BRE`/`NFO`. Everything else matches.

## Verified Fantrax facts (probed live 6 Aug 2026, both leagues)

The rehearsal league `zbn1z3ukmsgb36sz` was auto-drafted this morning: 4 teams,
15 rounds, 60 picks. `getTeamRosters` and `getStandings` returned populated
payloads for the first time, so the three reads above stopped being wishes.

**`getTeamRosters` takes a `period` parameter and echoes it back.** Previously
unknown. Shape is `{period, rosters: {teamId: {teamName, salaryCap, rosterItems:
[{id, position, status}]}}}`, status `ACTIVE`/`RESERVE`. Note the shape was not
merely unmodelled before — it was typed `Record<string, unknown>`, i.e. guessed
wrong, which is `CODE_RULES.md`'s "raw.ts no longer mirrors reality" refactor
trigger.

**Field presence varies between leagues, not just between states.** On the same
day, from the same method: the real league's `getLeagueInfo` carries `draftType`
and `leagueHistoryId`, the rehearsal league's carries neither. That is why every
raw field is optional, and it caught a live §5 violation — `mapLeagueInfo` did
`draftType: raw.draftType ?? ""`, which now reports a draft type Fantrax never
gave. It is `string | null`.

**Roster limits differ by league** — 15 total / 11 active / 5 reserve in the
rehearsal league against 14 / 11 / 3 in the real one, same position caps
(G1 D5 M5 F3). Leaving them mismatched was right: rendering both correctly is the
10 Oct swap, tested continuously instead of discovered on the day.

**`playerInfo.status` is an ownership flag.** Exactly the 60 rostered players are
`T`, 638 are `FA`, one is `WW`. Stays a raw string — the vocabulary is theirs.

**Standings shape is known and every value is zero**, because nothing has been
played. `points` is a `"0-0-0"` win-loss-tie string, left unparsed: splitting it
would infer a format from an all-zero sample. `gamesBack` and `winPercentage` are
derived by them and not mapped.

**The bridge resolved all 60 drafted players** — 50 exact, 10 fuzzy, zero misses,
60 distinct FPL codes. The launch gate most likely to embarrass us passes on real
rosters, and the one-to-one guarantee holds on live data.

**Degradation states multiply.** In a one-team dummy league, draft picks arrive
with no `playerId` at all and the roster is `[]` rather than a `NO_TEAMS` error.
Draft picks also arrive unsorted, and in an auto-draft every pick's `time` is
identical.

### The period↔gameweek alignment, settled — and the test that misleads

This was an open question. It is answered, and the obvious way to check it gives
the wrong answer:

- By **FPL deadline**, the two calendars disagree everywhere. Each deadline lands
  one period early — period 1 holds gameweek 2's — and around the September break
  period 3 gets no gameweek while period 4 gets two.
- By **fixture kickoff**, all 38 periods contain exactly the identically numbered
  gameweek. All 380 fixtures, zero mismatches, in both leagues.

Fantrax's period boundary sits inside the 90-minute gap between FPL's deadline and
that gameweek's first kickoff, which is what puts the deadline on the wrong side
of it. **Kickoff is the alignment key.** `deadline_time` is the field anyone
reaches for first, so `calendar.test.ts` asserts the wrong answer too, by name.

Both leagues carry byte-identical `scoringPeriods` today, but that is default
settings rather than a rule, so `npm run periods` checks each league separately
against live FPL. Postponements are the known future divergence: FPL keeps a
rearranged fixture in its original `event`, Fantrax scores it in the period
actually played.

**Position is league state, not football truth.** The commissioner can change a
player's position whenever they like, and `eligiblePos` is multi-valued (`"F,M"`,
`"M,D"` — 51 players today). It is a display hint and never a join key. The
player universe is mutable too: Fantrax carries academy players FPL has never
listed (699 real players against FPL's 570 non-manager elements), so `unmapped` is
a correct and permanent state for some players rather than a matching failure.

## Decisions

- **FPL has hard rules; custom rules are Fantrax's product.** This is *why* the
  two layers are separate, and it is sharper than "different providers". FPL
  models a game whose rules are fixed for everyone, so they can be constants. A
  Fantrax league models a game whose rules are the thing being sold: roster limits
  and position caps, the position vocabulary itself, the scoring system, the
  period calendar, the lineup deadline, team count, the matchup schedule, draft
  type, season bounds. **All of it is read from `getLeagueInfo`** — never assumed,
  never hardcoded, never inferred from the football layer. The two layers differ
  in epistemics, not just in content. `RosterLimits` is the precedent to copy.
- **The calendar is the second seam between the layers.** "They meet only through
  player identity" was true until periods needed aligning to gameweeks. The rule
  is now: the league layer may be *told* about the football calendar as plain
  data, but may never import the football adapter, and football may never import
  the league. `league/calendar.ts` declares its own `GameweekKickoff` rather than
  importing `Fixture`, the same move `identity/candidates.ts` makes with
  `FplCandidate`. A script does the wiring.
- **Snapshots are filed per league, and the pool is filed outside them.**
  `getPlayerIds` takes no leagueId and returns byte-identical answers for every
  league, so filing it under one would force `build-bridge.ts` to choose
  arbitrarily between two copies — and that arbitrary choice is the tell. It also
  keeps ~104 KB/day of duplication out of git.
- **Position left the football layer.** `FootballPlayer` no longer carries one.
  FPL's `element_type` is FPL's own fantasy classification, not a property of the
  footballer — Fantrax files the same player differently and lets them hold
  several positions at once. Neither provider is describing the real world, so a
  single `Position` in a layer that claims to be provider-neutral was a league
  concept wearing football clothes. Positions now exist only in the league layer,
  as `eligiblePositions`. Nothing in the UI read it, so there was no call site to
  migrate, and `element_type` stays in `fpl/raw.ts`, which mirrors the wire
  format whether or not we consume a field.
- **No scoring engine this season.** Fantrax computes the points and its numbers
  are authoritative; we read them. The full `scoringSystem` is captured but not
  modelled. Minor exceptions may come later, deliberately.
- **No write surface yet.** The fxpa methods (`confirmOrExecuteTeamRosterChanges`
  for lineups, `confirmOrExecutePlayerPickerChanges` for waivers) need a member's
  browser session cookie. Deferred to September. Note that before the draft there
  are no rosters to change, so there is nothing to test against either.
- **`data/` is checked into git.** The snapshots and the identity bridge are the
  season's permanent record; git is both audit trail and backup.
- **Capture starts now, not at the draft.** Roster transitions cannot be
  backfilled from anywhere — see below.

## Why the capture cannot wait

Fantrax serves current state only. It will not tell us in March who was benched in
October, and no archive holds our league: it sits behind a league id nothing
crawls. Any longitudinal question — form over time, who has been dropped by whom,
the FM-style player narratives we want in 27/28 — is answerable only from a record
we wrote ourselves, as it happened.

The sibling project (`~/ai-carling-premiership`) had exactly this and its per-GW
capture died silently at GW35. It survived only because FPL's bootstrap is a public
URL the Internet Archive happens to crawl monthly. We have no such luck, so the
failure mode to design against is silence, not error: `npm run capture:status`
reports the age of the last capture and exits non-zero when overdue.

Cadence is weekly until a league drafts and daily after, and both are per league:
the rehearsal league crossed that line on 6 Aug, the real one crosses it on
10 Oct, so `capture:status` reports each separately. One combined answer would
hide whichever of them stopped. Known blind spot: at daily granularity a player
added and dropped the same day is invisible. Revisit once the draft shows how much
same-day churn there actually is.

## Identity bridge

`data/mappings/fantrax.json`, generated by `npm run bridge`, audited by hand.
First run: **542 of 699 settled** — 474 exact, 66 fuzzy, 2 by curated alias.

The ladder is exact → alias → fuzzy, two passes per club, one-to-one. Exact
matches claim their FPL player before fuzzy matching can compete for them, and a
fuzzy win must clear 88, beat the runner-up by 3, and — where the win came from
one name containing the other — agree on the surname. That last guard is load
bearing: `token_set_ratio` scores containment at 100, so "Gabriel" ties perfectly
with both Arsenal's Gabriel and Gabriel Jesus.

Three bugs worth remembering, all found by running against the real pool rather
than by the test suite:

1. **The surname guard read the wrong end of the name.** Fantrax writes
   surname-first, so the last token of its raw form is the *given* name. The guard
   was asking whether FPL's player is called "Danny" and rejecting Daniel Ballard.
   Every diminutive failed this way — Josh/Joshua, Ben/Benjamin — while looking
   like a careful refusal. It reads the reading-order form now.
2. **Apostrophes.** Fantrax writes `OBrien`, FPL writes `O'Brien`. Normalising the
   apostrophe to a space split one token into two sharing nothing with the other,
   dropping completely unambiguous names below threshold. Deleted, not spaced.
3. **Claimed codes did not survive a re-run.** The one-to-one guard was per-run,
   so a code won on run one was free again on run two: Jack Clarke matched, then
   Harry Clarke took his code. Three FPL players ended up with two claimants. The
   matcher is now seeded from the existing bridge.

Re-runs revise one thing and one thing only: the script's own assumptions. Every
match, and every `unmapped` row a person wrote or confirmed, survives untouched —
the pool mutates constantly, and a run that quietly overwrote a human decision
would be untrustworthy exactly where it was most carefully made. See the residue
section below for why the assumptions are the exception.

### Ranking the audit

`confidence` cannot rank it: every fuzzy row scores 100, because
`token_set_ratio` saturates whenever one name's tokens contain the other's.
`MappedEntry.agreement` is the second signal — it compares the two *full* names
and reports `identical`, `contained` or `conflicting`. Full names only: FPL
publishes a bare surname as a name variant, so scoring against variants makes
every genuine conflict read as containment.

That splits the 66 fuzzy rows **53 `contained` / 13 `conflicting`**. Eleven of the
thirteen are plainly one player written two ways (Danny/Daniel Ballard,
Kostas/Konstantinos Tsimikas, Djordje/Đorđe Petrović — Serbian `Đ` transliterates
to `Dj` in one feed and folds to `d` in ours). Two looked unsettleable from the
payloads alone, because the feeds agree on club *and* position but not on given
name:

- `Andrews, Keith` → `Kaine Andrews` (COV)
- `Koumas, Louie` → `Lewis Koumas` (LIV)

**Settled 19 Aug 2026, all 13 `conflicting` rows audited.** Club is a hard filter
before fuzzy scoring ever runs, so both pools held exactly one candidate of that
surname — the same uniqueness that makes the other eleven obviously one player
(Ballard, Tsimikas, Petrović, ...) applies here too. Two different real people
sharing a surname *and* a specific club, with FPL listing only one of them, is
the coincidence that would have to be true for these to be wrong; a first-name
slip in one feed is the far likelier read. Signed off as correct rather than
overridden to `unmapped`.

Adding the field changed no assignment: regenerating from an empty bridge
reproduced the same 542 rows with zero `fplCode` reassignments.

### What the coverage number means

78% understates it badly. Roster limits are 14 players across 16 teams, so **224
of the 699 will ever be rostered**. Against FPL's top 224 by price the bridge
covers 223 — and the miss, Nicolas Jackson, is absent from Fantrax's pool
entirely rather than unmatched. The 157 then in review were overwhelmingly academy
players nobody will draft: 156 of them scored below 60 against their best
candidate, which is noise. The single real match in that pile was `Ehor Yarmolyuk`
→ `Yehor Yarmoliuk` at 72, a Ukrainian transliteration that belonged in the alias
file — and the residue section below is how that one row stopped being buried
under the other 156.

**Outstanding:** the 13 `conflicting` rows are now audited (see above); the other
555 mapped rows — 499 exact, 53 fuzzy `contained`, 3 alias — still have
`auditedAt` unset.

### The residue, and why the script may answer for it

*19 Aug 2026.* The review file held 157 rows, of which perhaps two were real
questions. Nothing separated them, so nobody read it, which is the failure mode
worth naming: a review file that is never empty enough to read is a review file
that does not exist.

`UnmappedEntry` now records **who concluded it**, not just that it was concluded.
`unmappedBy: "no-fpl-match"` is the script's; `"manual"` is a person's, and no
threshold may ever write it. `auditedAt` stays a separate question — a person may
confirm what the script concluded, and doing so is what makes the row final.

That split buys the thing `auditedAt` alone could not: **an assumption is
recorded but not settled.** "Nobody in FPL looks like him" is only ever true of
the list that run read, and FPL adds players all window. So `settledIds` leaves
assumed ids out and they go back through the matcher every run, and `mergeBridge`
keeps an assumption only by being handed it again — the mechanism that promotes an
academy player FPL lists in January, and the one that stops the file claiming "no
FPL counterpart" about somebody this run has just sent to review instead. It
earns its keep immediately: the first run over the 19 Aug pool dropped 32 rows
recorded against pools the commissioner has since trimmed, and turned 6 more
into exact matches.

**`ABSENCE_MAX_SCORE = 50`, and it is not `FUZZY_MIN_SCORE`.** 88 asks "is this
him?"; the ceiling asks "is anyone here close enough that a person should look?",
and between 51 and 87 the honest answers are no and yes. Set below the hole in the
first residue's distribution (92 scored rows, 17–72, empty between 55 and 72). The
tempting ceiling is the empty band just under 88, and it is a trap: the top score
in the file was `Ehor Yarmolyuk` → `Yehor Yarmoliuk` at 72, the same Brentford
midfielder. A ceiling above him files a first-team starter as absent and nobody
ever looks again.

Bridge now, against the 19 Aug pool: **688 rows — 568 mapped (499 exact, 66
fuzzy, 3 alias), 120 `no-fpl-match`, review 3.** The three are academy players
scoring 52–55 against unrelated seniors — the residue the ceiling exists to
surface, and a person's call. Yarmolyuk is the third alias.

The totals track the pool rather than accumulating, which is the point: a bridge
row for a player Fantrax no longer carries is only worth keeping when somebody
decided it.

## Recorded rule exceptions

Each entry is a deliberate departure from `CODE_RULES.md`, recorded in the commit
that made it.

### `revalidate` literal in every route segment (§3, no hardcoding)

Next requires a route segment's `export const revalidate` to be a statically
analysable literal, so it cannot be imported from `packages/core/src/config.ts`.
Every route segment therefore repeats `PAGE_REVALIDATE` as a literal, and every
route added later will too — a standing exception, not a per-file one. The
`PAGE_REVALIDATE` docblock in core config is the canonical statement; a comment
at each site points back to it. They all change together.

(This entry used to name one file and one export that no longer exists. An
explicit list of route files is the thing that rotted, which is why there is no
longer one here.)

### The root layout swallows a failed snapshot read (§2, no defensive try/catch)

`footballIsOn()` in `apps/companion/app/layout.tsx` wraps `getFootballSnapshot()`
in a `try/catch` that returns `true`. §2 forbids exactly this — swallow and
default — and the rest of the tree honours it: the FPL client says so in a
comment as it rethrows, and `refusals.ts` catches only `FantraxError`.

It stands here for two reasons that do not apply anywhere else. A root layout
that throws takes **every route** down with it, including the pages that would
otherwise have rendered fine and reported the failure themselves; there is no
`error.tsx` in the app, so the alternative is a blank screen for a tab bar.
And the default is chosen, not convenient: **it fails open**, showing the
Matchday tab rather than hiding it. A tab that should not be there leads to a
page that says plainly it could not read anything; a section that silently
vanishes mid-match is the failure nobody can diagnose from a phone.

If an `error.tsx` ever lands, this should be revisited — that is the shape that
would let the layout throw honestly.

### Branching on a Fantrax error code in `app/squad/league.ts` (§3-adjacent)

The adapter deliberately never branches on a specific code — the vocabulary is
undocumented and inconsistent, so `errors.ts` keys off the envelope's presence
alone, and that rule stands where it is: in detection, where a code cannot be
trusted to identify a condition.

`getLeagueSquads` breaks it, once, in presentation. It treats `NO_TEAMS` as "no
squads exist yet" and every other code as "Fantrax did not answer", because
collapsing the two tells sixteen managers with drafted squads that nobody has
drafted, on the strength of a five-minute outage. The allowlist is safe here
precisely because it fails toward hedging: an unrecognised code says Fantrax is
not answering, which is a hedged right answer even for a league that genuinely
has no teams. The reverse — a confident wrong one — is what principle 4 forbids.

### Next's `next.revalidate` inside `packages/core` (§5) — RESOLVED, removed

Both provider clients used to pass Next's `next: { revalidate }` extension to
`fetch`, which §5 forbids inside core. Resolved by deleting it rather than by
typing around it: the clients now use plain `fetch` with standard options only,
and freshness is the route's business via each segment's `revalidate`.

The cost is real and accepted: per-endpoint TTLs are gone, so a page render
refetches bootstrap (1.3 MB) rather than reusing a data-cache entry. FPL's API is
public and unmetered, and a rules-clean core is worth more than the bytes.

Follow-up worth knowing about: `/gw/[gameweek]` builds as a dynamic route, so it
re-renders per request instead of being served from the full route cache. That
was masked before by fetch-level caching. Not worth acting on until the app is
actually in front of people after the draft — noted so it is a decision rather
than a surprise.

Also note: `npm run typecheck` had never passed before this — the failure was
invisible because `CLAUDE.md`'s verify section lists only `npm test` and
`npm run build`. Both now gate every commit alongside typecheck.

### `process.env` inside `packages/core/src/config.ts` (§5, purity at the core)

`FANTRAX_LEAGUE_ID` reads the environment, defaulting to the rehearsal league.
Setting that variable is the entire 10 Oct swap, and it is what lets CI point a
build at the real (empty) league today and watch every view meet its empty states.

§5's ban on environment reads names mappers, scoring and engines — the places
where an unseen `process.env` makes behaviour untestable. A config module is the
one place the read is legible, and §3 explicitly offers "one config module or
environment" as the home for a league id.

Core's tsconfig still omits node types, so nothing in `packages/core` can reach
for `fs`. The single global is declared locally in `config.ts` rather than opening
that door for one string.

### `codeHashes()` swallows a malformed `TEAM_CODES` (§2, no defensive try/catch)

*Recorded 19 Aug 2026, on the doc-truth sweep — the code predates the note.*

`app/squad/session.ts` parses the sign-in map out of an environment variable and
returns `{}` when the JSON will not parse, which is exactly the swallow §2
forbids. Kept, for one reason: the alternative failure is worse in both
directions. Throwing takes down every page including the ones that need no
identity at all, and salvaging half-parsed JSON to let *somebody* in is a
security decision made by a parser.

`{}` fails closed and fails visibly — nobody can sign in, sixteen people say so
within the hour, and every read-only view still works. It is the same shape as
the root layout's swallow above and kept for the same reason.

### New dependency: `tsx` (§2, every dependency is a recorded decision)

Dev-only, never shipped. The capture and bridge runners import `@epl/core`, whose
relative imports are extensionless, which Node's native type-stripping will not
resolve. `tsx` is the smallest thing that runs them unchanged.

Scripts transpile to CJS (the root package has no `"type": "module"`), so they
cannot use top-level `await` — each wraps its body in `main()` and calls it
without awaiting, so a rejection crashes the run loudly instead of being softened.

## The Premier League palette we were using was four years out of date (7 Aug 2026)

Every football-register token in `globals.css` was the 2016 set. Read out of the
live sources instead — `premierleague.com/resources/v1.51.2-1/styles/screen.css`
and FPL's production bundle `assets/index-9PDTUlDh.js`.

| role | was (2016) | is (2023 refresh) |
|---|---|---|
| PL Purple | `#38003c` | `#37003c` |
| PL Green | `#00ff85` | `#00ff87` |
| PL Blue (the cyan; their token says "blue") | `#04f5ff` | `#05f0ff` |
| PL Pink | `#e90052` | `#ff2882` |

`#38003c` appears **zero** times in premierleague.com's current 2.4 MB stylesheet.
Every brand-colours aggregator on the web still publishes the old set, which is
where ours came from. The palette also grew: lilac `#953bff`, yellow `#ebff00`,
orange `#ff6900`. None of the three is a token here yet because nothing uses
them — the lilac is FPL's own gradient partner (`linear-gradient(90deg, #05f0ff,
#953bff)`) and is the obvious register for the FPL tab when it lands.

Pink is the one that mattered. `#e90052` → `#ff2882` takes `--color-live` from
4.31:1 to 5.52:1 on `--color-bg`; the old value was failing AA on the one thing
that has to be read at arm's length.

**We deliberately diverge from them on one binding.** Their `--theme-live` is PL
Orange `#ff6900`, and `.badge--live` uses it. We keep pink, because orange sits
in the same warm band as Tim Hortons red `#C8102E` and the two would muddle on a
masthead carrying both. Pink is still theirs — it is `--theme-hyperlink` in their
dark theme.

Other facts worth not re-deriving:

- **Their pitch** is `/assets/pitch-graphic-t77-OTdp.svg`, a perspective
  trapezoid: base `#00A34F`, four mow bands in `#009B4C` (2–3% darker, not more)
  whose heights *grow* toward the viewer — 63.6, 63.6, 85.9, 132 in a 788-tall
  viewBox. That growth is what sells the perspective, which is why our `.pitch`
  cannot be a repeating gradient. Our ramp holds their hue and band contrast but
  sits ~12% darker: `#00A34F` is right on a white app and a wall of green on a
  near-black one.
- **Their pitch tile** is 67×92 on mobile, 112×140 from 700px, and is three
  stacked parts: shirt, name bar, details bar. The details bar has three states —
  fixture text, the orange→pink live gradient, then flat `#37003c` with the
  points. Ours is the same three-part shape with a photograph instead of a shirt.
- **Their neutrals are never neutral**: the mono ramp holds hue ~321–326
  throughout. Ours already did, at 320.
- **Kit sprites**, if we ever want them: `/dist/img/shirts/{standard|special}/
  shirt_{team_code}{_1 for GK}-{66|110|220}.{webp|png}`. Verified 200.
- **Tim Hortons** is `#C8102E`, from their own markup. Their palette since the
  2017 rebrand is red and white only; the cream in our tokens is the 1964–85
  identity's register, chosen deliberately because the album is a period object.

## Rule exception: the bridge is asserted, not parsed, at the app edge

`apps/companion/app/squad/league.ts` does `mapping as Bridge` on the JSON import.
`resolveJsonModule` widens `matchedBy` to `string` and the compiler cannot see
that `scripts/build-bridge.ts` only ever writes the four literals. The
alternatives were worse: loosening `MappedEntry.matchedBy` to `string` gives up
the type everywhere to serve one import, and hand-parsing 544 rows at request
time buys nothing, since the file is ours and generated rather than scraped.
Asserted once, at the single edge, with the reason written at the site.

## The one football fact the league layer cannot supply

`join/lineup.ts` declares `PITCH_ORDER = ["G", "D", "M", "F"]`.

`getLeagueInfo` gives the position vocabulary and the per-position caps —
`{ G: 1, D: 5, M: 5, F: 3 }` — and CLAUDE.md is right that the vocabulary is
league data we must never assume. But nothing in that payload says a goalkeeper
stands *behind* a defender, and no other Fantrax read carries it either. So the
depth ordering is declared once, in the join, with the caps still read from the
league. A letter the order has never seen renders at the front rather than in
goal: a commissioner adding "W" for wingers should look wrong, not wrong in a way
that reads as correct.


## Verified Fantrax facts (probed live 12 Aug 2026, against real transactions)

Craig executed a trade (9:13AM EDT) and a free-agent claim with a drop (9:14AM)
in the rehearsal league. Captures either side of them, plus a probe, settled
three open questions at once.

### Transactions are a first-class read, and public

`POST /fxpa/req` → **`getTransactionDetailsHistory`** returns typed, timestamped
transaction records **without a cookie**. This corrects the 7 Aug note that had
it behind auth. It takes `view`, and `displayedLists.tabs` is the server-driven
list of legal values — currently `CLAIM_DROP`, `TRADE`, `LINEUP_CHANGE`.

What each row carries: `scorer` (a full player object whose `scorerId` **is our
fantraxId**, with `posShortNames` for eligibility), `txSetId` grouping both
halves of a trade or a claim+drop, `resultCode`/`executed`, and `cells` keyed
`from` / `to` / `team` / `date` / `week`. `TRADE` rows name both sides
explicitly; `CLAIM_DROP` rows add `transactionCode` (`CLAIM`/`DROP`) and
`claimType` (`FA`). The trade rows carry **no** `transactionCode` — for trades
the *view* is the type.

**Bind to `cell.key`, never to the header name.** The `week` column's header
name arrives as the literal string `"{0} on which this transaction takes
effect"` — an unsubstituted i18n placeholder shipped to production. Its
`shortName` is "Gameweek" and its `key` is `week`. Any parser keyed off the
English name is built on text Fantrax itself cannot render correctly.

**This displaces the capture-diff derivation as the primary source.** Diffing
consecutive captures does work — it found both events unaided — but it is
strictly weaker: it cannot name a transaction type, cannot see two moves in one
day, and cannot tell a trade from a commissioner override. The native feed does
all three and timestamps them to the minute. Capture-diff stays as
corroboration, and the three views should themselves be captured daily so we
own an archive of a feed Fantrax could prune.

`getTransactions` (no "Details") exists, is public, and returned an empty
`transactions: []` throughout — not the same thing, and not the one we want.
`getPendingTransactions` answered `noPendingTransactions`.

### One week, two reads — the feed's ordering problem (19 Aug 2026)

The paper read `CLAIM_DROP` and nothing else, so **the rehearsal league's only
trade had never appeared on the front page.** Not a rendering bug: for a trade
the *view* is the type, and a paper that reads one view reports every waiver
claim in the league and none of its business.

Reading both raises the question one view never did. Each view arrives
newest-first *on its own*, so concatenating them gives every claim, then every
trade, which is not a week. `deals()` used to say its ordering came from the feed
and that sorting by `processedAt` "would mean inventing a date format". That
stands for an instant and not for an order:

- **A sort key is not a timestamp.** "Wed Aug 12, 2026, 9:14AM" carries no
  offset — Fantrax puts that in the column heading, as `Date Processed (EDT)` —
  but every row in one league's feed is in one displayed timezone, so comparing
  them needs no offset at all. `orderKey` composes an integer, is used for
  nothing but `sort`, and `Deal.processedAt` stays their string verbatim.
- **It is all-or-nothing.** A row whose date will not parse — a translated month,
  a changed format — returns the feed order untouched rather than sorting around
  the gap. A partial sort would place that row by an accident of the comparator,
  and the order it displaced was at least each view's own truth.

`LINEUP_CHANGE` stays captured daily and stays out of the paper: benching
somebody is not business anyone did with anyone, and on sixteen teams it would
bury the two moves that are.

Verified against the 12 Aug captures rather than fixtures — the claim/drop pair
and the trade, told as two stories, in the minute order Fantrax processed them.

### What the capture diff saw, for the record

Status alone (`playerInfo[].status`) caught only the claim: Gibbs-White `T→WW`,
Schade `FA→T`. **The trade is invisible to a status diff** — both players stay
`T` — and surfaced only by comparing *owners* across teams. Any derivation must
compare ownership, not status. That is now a recorded fixture rather than a
prediction.

### `?period=N` is accepted, echoed, and inert

`getTeamRosters?period=1|2|5` all echo the requested period back and return
**byte-identical rosters** (same payload hash), all reflecting post-trade state.
So it does not serve history today. This does not yet distinguish "projection"
from "ignored": no period has *completed*, so there is no past for it to serve.
Re-ask after period 1 closes on 28 Aug.

Until then the answer that matters is unchanged and now evidenced: **past
lineups exist only in our capture archive.** The doctrine holds.

## The lineup preview is gated on the league, not on an environment variable

The planner has to be visible during development, and the visibility gate hides
every lineup until 21 Aug. The obvious lever is an env flag. We did not use one.

An env flag is correct until the day it is set on the deployment, and the harm it
guards against is asymmetric: publishing sixteen managers' lineups before a
deadline is the one mistake in this app that cannot be taken back. So the check
is **which league we serve** — the rehearsal league's four teams belong to
nobody, so previewing there leaks nothing, and the real league can never preview
whatever anyone configures. It **fails closed**: if the real league cannot be
identified in `FANTRAX_LEAGUES` at all, the answer is no, because the other
direction fails toward publishing.

It is also opt-in per request (`?preview=1`) rather than always-on, so the honest
gate remains the default on every page load and remains the thing under test. On
10 Oct the swap turns the planner preview off by itself, which is correct.

`mayPreviewLineups()` lives in `apps/companion/app/squad/league.ts` and is not
unit-tested, because vitest covers `packages/*` only. That is the standing gap
for app-edge logic; this is the piece of it most worth watching.

## A second client component, on purpose

`AutoRefresh` was the app's only `"use client"` file and its comment said so
deliberately. `LineupPlanner` is the second, and it earns it: the whole feature
is an XI you rearrange and look at before committing, so the edited shape has to
live in browser state.

It reuses `lineup()` and `Pitch` unchanged by rebuilding a `RosteredTeam` from
the edited slots, rather than growing a second renderer that can drift from the
real one. The planner never writes: it ends in an outbound link, and
`FANTRAX_APP_BASE` deliberately stops at the league path — the only URL shape
confirmed from a real browser session. A deeper guess at their roster route would
break silently the day they reorganise.

Only the fifteen squad members' eligibility crosses to the browser, not the
pool's 697.

## `getPlayerProfile`, probed live (12 Aug 2026) — do not re-derive

Public on fxpa, no cookie. Verbatim responses for a rostered player and a free
agent are in `data/probes/2026-08-12/`.

- **The parameter is `playerId`.** `scorerId` — Fantrax's own name for the
  identical id on the transaction rows — and `fantraxId` both answer
  `INVALID_REQUEST`. One id space, three names for it, one that works.
- **A third fxpa failure shape exists**: the refusal came back as a top-level
  `pageError` *and* as `responses[0].pageError`, which is neither of the two
  shapes `errors.ts` documents. `unwrapFxpa` catches it because it checks the top
  level first. Nothing needs changing; it is recorded so the next reader knows the
  nesting is not a third detector waiting to be written.
- **The numbers are last season's.** `displayedSelections.seasonId` was `925`
  while `season` said 2026-27 is `926`: the profile serves the most recent season
  actually played. Before GW1 that is 2025-26, so every points figure on the page
  belongs to a season that has to be named beside it. The season is resolved by
  matching the id against the seasons the payload itself names, never assumed.
- **Provenance splits four ways inside one `miscData`**: `leagueData` is our
  league's row (status/team, FPts, eligibility), `highlightStats` is Fantrax's
  scoring and rankings, `percentDrafted` + `averageDraftPosition` are
  whole-of-Fantrax, `personalInfo` is the man. They render as four blocks under
  four headings. "100% rostered" means every league on the site and sits two rows
  from our own ownership.
- `percentOwned` and `percentActive` are **not mapped**, deviating from the plan.
  They arrive as three items labelled only "This Week", "Last Week", "Next Week",
  so taking a figure means binding to an English name — the trap `transactions.ts`
  already names — and both numbers arrive again in `highlightStats` with their
  meaning spelled out.
- `ownerTeamId` is null for a free agent and the fantasy team id otherwise,
  agreeing with the rosters.
- `miscData.icons[]` carries dated Fantrax news, truncated with an ellipsis. Not
  read: injury news is a football fact and the football layer already has FPL's,
  untruncated.
- `headshotUrl` is the **club crest** when they have no photo
  (`usesTeamLogoAsHeadshot: true`), so it cannot be rendered as a portrait.
- `sectionContent` (stats, splits, game logs) is refused rather than forgotten:
  most of the payload's weight, columns keyed by numeric stat ids, no consumer.
- ADP is real and public here (`averageDraftPosition`), which is the trade scout's
  value map when it lands.

## A third client component: the tab bar

`TabNav` is `"use client"` for one reason — `usePathname`. A tab bar that
cannot say which section you are in is a row of links, and the answer only exists
in the browser. Nothing else in it is interactive.

Each tab owns a set of routes rather than the single one it links to, so reading
a squad (`/squad/[teamId]`) or a past gameweek (`/gw/[n]`) keeps its section lit.
It carries its own `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` padding: the body's padding does
nothing for a fixed element, which is positioned against the viewport.

**One component in two shapes** (13 Aug): a fixed bottom bar on a phone, a sticky
masthead row at the top from `md` up. It was `BottomNav` and is now `TabNav`,
because the name had stopped being true at half the widths we serve. Two
components would mean two copies of the route-ownership table, and the copy not
on the phone is the one that would rot. It renders *before* `<main>` so the
desktop bar can be sticky in normal flow; on a phone `fixed` takes it out of flow
and document order costs nothing. The active indicator flips edges with the bar —
`border-t` under a thumb, `border-b` under a masthead.

Two in-content links became redundant the moment it landed and one of them went:
the undrafted state's "The football, meanwhile" is now the Matchday tab. "Every
squad" on a team page stays — it is an up-link within a section, not navigation
between them.

## The pool page: status is league state, not a player fact

Our real league marks **all 697 players `WW`** while it has no teams; the
rehearsal league splits them `FA 630 / T 60 / WW 7`. A players page that defaulted
to "free agents" would therefore be **empty in the league we ship on 10 Oct** and
full in the one we develop against — the exact class of bug the two-league
discipline exists to catch, and it was caught by reading both captures rather
than by a test. So: no default filter, and the status chips are built from the
statuses actually present with their counts, labelled where we recognise the code
and shown raw where we do not.

Ownership is computed from the rosters, never read off the status letter. The two
answer different questions — `status` is what may be *done* with a player,
ownership is who *has* him — and in an undrafted league both are true at once:
everyone is waiver-wire and nobody is owned.

`getTeamRosters` answering `NO_TEAMS` is therefore survivable here and is the only
failure that is. Any other roster failure fails the whole page, because the
alternative is 697 rows quietly claiming nobody owns anybody.

Filter state lives in the URL, so the page stays a server component, the pool
never crosses to the phone as data, and a manager can send someone a link to
exactly what he is looking at. Nothing is truncated: all 697 rows render, ~84 KB
gzipped, and the header states the count in view against the total.

## What `violations()` deliberately cannot say

Fantrax publishes `maxActive` per position and **no minimum**. So "only two
defenders" breaks no rule anyone set: an under-filled XI is legal, and a type
called `Violation` must not carry it. The planner says it in its own words
instead — *n* empty places, allowed, and nothing scores from them.

Everything it does report is reachable without a single illegal move, because the
lineup we are handed is Fantrax's. Craig narrowed eligibility across the league on
12 Aug; the same edit under a set XI leaves a player standing somewhere he is no
longer eligible for, and `legalMoves` — which only ever offers legal moves — would
never mention it. Eligibility we do not hold is never reported as eligibility a
player lacks: that violation has no move that clears it, so the wrong answer
strands a manager rather than merely misinforming him.

## `getMatchups` is not public (probed live 13 Aug 2026) — do not re-derive

Both leagues, with and without a `period` parameter, answer
`WARNING_NOT_LOGGED_IN` — four byte-identical refusals, filed in
`data/probes/2026-08-13/`. The public/private line on fxpa runs per method, and
this one sits on the far side with `getScorerDetails`, not with `getStandings`
and `getPlayerProfile`.

Consequence, designed in rather than worked around: **/matchup shows the pairing
from `getLeagueInfo.matchups` and countable events, never points.** Fantrax's
live H2H totals stay authoritative and stay on Fantrax until a cookie flow
exists. When the visibility gate opens a period, each side of a pairing shows
the active eleven's summed events (G/A/CS/YC/RC) from FPL's public feed,
labelled as events; before it opens the page shows pairings only, because a
two-team screen is the easiest place in the app to leak a lineup. Whether
`getMatchups` carries totals, a server-driven period list, or only the schedule
remains unknowable until a cookie is in hand — re-probe then.

**Re-probed with a cookie the same evening, and the answer is: only the
schedule.** No score, no result, no state. See the 13 Aug sweep below — the
totals we wanted are on `getLiveScoringStats`, which needs no cookie at all.

## The fxpa sweep with a member cookie (13 Aug 2026) — the big one

Craig put his Fantrax session cookie in `.env.local` (gitignored, read from the
environment, never logged). That let us probe every method the SPA uses, each one
twice — anonymously and authenticated — and the answers rewrite what this app has
to build. Verbatim bodies for 41 calls are in `data/probes/2026-08-13/`. The
headline: **almost everything we wanted is public, and the one thing that was
login-walled turns out to be worthless.**

### `getMatchups` is a schedule and nothing else — stop wanting it

It is cookie-walled, as recorded on 13 Aug, and now we know what is behind the
wall: 34 KB containing `periods[].matchups[].{homeTeam,awayTeam}` and no score of
any kind. A leaf census over the whole tree found exactly three numeric leaves —
the period number, `regularSeasonEndPeriod: 38`, and a server clock — and the
substrings `fpts`/`score`/`point`/`win`/`result` appear nowhere. Its 38 × 2
pairings reproduce the **public** `getLeagueInfo.matchups` exactly, orientation
included (the order of the two matchups within a period differs in 19 of 38
periods, which is presentation, not data). `period` is accepted and ignored:
requesting period 1 returns a byte-identical body but for the clock.

So the open question "does `getMatchups` carry totals — re-probe when a cookie
exists" is **answered: it does not, and it never will, because the schema has
nowhere to put a score.** It is not a reason to build a cookie flow.

### `getTeamRosterInfo` is public, parameterised, and carries Fantrax's own points

The roster page. Public, and it accepts `teamId`, `period`, `view`,
`seasonOrProjection` and `scoringCategoryType`, all echoed back in
`displayedSelections`. So we can read **every squad, for every one of 38 periods,
without a session.** It carries:

- the full roster with `posId` (the slot), `statusId` (1 active / 2 reserve) and
  the player's real fixture — empty slots appear as rows with a `posId` and **no
  `scorer` key**, so never assume a row has a player;
- **per-player fantasy points under our own league's scoring** — two tables,
  keeper and outfield, whose headers key off `fpts`, `fptsPerGame`, and then the
  stat columns themselves (`GP Min G A AF YC RC PKM OG GAO CS`, plus `Sv GA PKS`
  for keepers);
- `view: "FPTS"` re-renders those same columns as *points contributed per
  category*, and they sum exactly to the total — verified on 30 of 30 rows across
  two teams. That is a points breakdown we do not have to compute;
- `periodOppnentTeamIds` (their typo) — **the opponent for the requested period**,
  matching the cookie-walled `getMatchups` exactly. The pairing is public here.

Anonymous and authenticated responses were fetched for the same team and diffed
cell by cell: **identical**. The cookie adds `commissioner`, `isMyTeam` and the
caller's `roles`, and nothing about the football.

### `getLiveScoringStats` is public and typed — the live scoreboard

The live-scoring page, and the first Fantrax payload we have seen that is *data*
rather than rendering instructions: no cells, no pixel widths, no formatted
numbers. Per fantasy team, keyed by team id, for all teams at once:

- `statsPerTeam.allTeamsStats[teamId].ACTIVE.totalFpts` — a **typed int**, the
  team's fantasy points for the period. Zero today because the season has not
  kicked off, so *that it fills in live is an expectation, not an observation* —
  re-probe on 21 Aug before anything depends on it;
- `projectedTotalsMap` / `calculatedProjectedTotalsMap` — **typed floats**,
  Fantrax's own per-player projection for the period (identical to each other
  today). Players are **omitted rather than zeroed** when there is no projection;
- `gameStatusMap` — the one formatted string: `"@FUL~1787598000000|06m5p|1"` is
  away, opponent, kickoff epoch ms, Fantrax game id, status;
- `remainingEventPercent` — typed, 1 when the fixture has not started, which is
  how "three of your eleven still to play" gets answered;
- `playerGameInfo` — five unlabelled ints, `[0,0,11,0,990]` = eleven players to
  play, 990 minutes. **Absent on BENCH, not null.**

`period` is honoured. `matchupId` is **not** — passing the one from their own URL
returns a byte-identical body, so their matchup view filters client-side and the
payload always carries the whole league. The **`BENCH` block is cookie-only**;
anonymous callers get `ACTIVE`, which is what scores anyway. Per-player *points*
(`statsMap`, `statsMap2`) are `{}` in every section, so what they will hold is
unknown.

### `getPlayerStats` is public — and its default view is a projection

The players page: 708 players, 20 per page, 36 pages. Rows carry `scorerId` (our
`fantraxId`), the player's news `icons`, and **which of our teams owns him**
(`cells[1].teamId`) — ownership in our league, public.

Two traps, both load-bearing:

- **The default is `PROJECTION_0_926_SEASON`.** Haaland's "179" is Fantrax's
  projection for a season that has not started, not anything anyone has scored.
  The season must be read from `displayedSeasonOrProjection`, never assumed —
  the same currentOrRecentSeason trap `getPlayerProfile` set, in a new place.
  **Corrected 13 Aug (evening):** this note originally said the real views "must
  be asked for by code". They cannot be asked for here at all — see below.
- **The default column set is seven wide** — Rk, Status, Opp, FPts, FP/G, Ros,
  +/- — and carries no football stats at all. The stat columns live on
  `getTeamRosterInfo`, or behind `scoringCategoryType` ("5" Tracked, "1"
  Standard — and Standard is *not* a superset: it drops AF, PKM, OG and GAO).

Every cell is a pre-formatted string, with the usual damage: a literal `<br/>`
inside `"BOU<br/>Sun 9:00AM"`, a `<small>` tag in a waiver cell, and FP/G with
zero, one or two decimal places in the same column.

### The stat reads, probed to exhaustion (13 Aug evening) — the Players rehaul's whole scope

Fourteen anonymous probes, filed in `data/probes/2026-08-13/`. Between them they
deleted a week of planned work and settled how the Players tab is built.

**`getPlayerStats` will not serve a season total. At all.** Every spelling was
tried — `seasonOrProjection` with a YTD code, plus `timeframeTypeCode`,
`statisticsTimeframeType`, `timeframeType`, `statsType`, `statisticsViewTypeId`,
`timeStartType`, explicit `startDate`/`endDate`, a bare `SEASON_925`, an object
instead of a string, and `view: "FPTS"`. All fourteen answered 200 with a
projection. The tell is in the echo: ask for `SEASON_925_YEAR_TO_DATE` and it
answers `SEASON_925_PROJECTED_SEASON` whose name is the untranslated placeholder
`"2025-26 - ???type.statisticsTimeframeType.projectedSeason.shortName: en_US???"`
— a server-side fallback constructing a code it has no label for. **So asking is
not knowing, and the only honest column heading is the one read back off the
answer.** Whether it flips to real numbers once games exist is unknown and
resolves itself on 21 Aug; nothing needs rebuilding either way, because the page
already prints whatever season came back.

**`maxResultsPerPage` is honoured far past their own UI's twenty.** 1000 returns
all 708 rows in one request (533 KB) with `totalNumPages: 1`. The planned 36-call
pagination and the 37-call FPL season sweep are both deleted. `POOL_PAGE_SIZE`
sits comfortably above the pool and the read reports `totalNumResults` back, so a
pool that ever outgrows it says so rather than showing a prefix.

**`getTeamRosterInfo` is the real find, and it is public.** It *does* honour
`seasonOrProjection` — `SEASON_926_YEAR_TO_DATE` comes back correctly labelled
"2026-27 - YTD" — and `teamId` and `period` are honoured too. With `view: "FPTS"`
each player's total is broken into the league's own scoring categories, and they
**sum to it exactly**: verified on all sixteen rostered players, e.g. Martinez
109 = Min 63 + CS 28 − GA 11 + Sv 23 − YC 2 + PKS 5 + A 3. Games played sits on
the same row and is a count, not points, so it is excluded from the sum exactly
as their own table excludes it.

Shape notes that the mapper depends on:

- **Two tables, one per scoring group** (`scGroupScorerHeader`: "Goalkeeper",
  "Outfielder"), with **different columns** — keepers get CS/GA/Sv/PKS, outfield
  gets GAO. Flattening them would file a keeper's saves under an outfielder's
  goals-against. The same split `ScoringRules` already carries.
- **Columns are identified by `scipId`**, not by display label. The fixed columns
  (`opponent`, `fpts`, `fptsPerGame`) carry a `key` and the categories carry
  both; matching on "CS" would break the day Fantrax translates a header.
- **`header.cells[].name` publishes Fantrax's own definition** after a ` -- `.
  This is where their rules live, and the player card shows it on hover.
- **Empty roster slots are real rows** with real blank cells and no `scorer`.
- Cells are formatted strings: `"2,835"` for minutes, a bare `"-"` for a category
  a player never registered — which is absence, not nought.
- An undrafted league refuses with `pageError.code: "WARNING"`, "You cannot use
  this screen until there is at least one team in this league." The real league's
  state until 10 Oct, and an ordinary one.

**The season code is looked up, never written down.** Only `getPlayerStats`
publishes the list (`displayedLists.displayedSeasonOrProjections`, 35 entries),
so one cheap cached call learns it and the team reads use it. It is chosen by
`startDate`, not by list position and not by parsing the season number out of the
code — `seasonYear: 2026` maps to `926`, but inferring "subtract 1100" from two
data points is exactly the kind of invented rule §3 forbids.

### Fantrax's clean-sheet rule is published, and it is 60 minutes

Found in a column tooltip rather than by watching a match, which partly answers
the 21 Aug question before 21 Aug:

> **Clean Sheets On Field** — Awarded to a player who played at least 60 minutes
> and whose team gave up 0 goals during the time the player was on the field,
> even if a goal was scored after the player left the field.

So `CLEAN_SHEET_MINUTES = 60` in `join/cleanSheets.ts` matches their threshold,
and our preview is priced on the right rule. **One difference remains**, and it
runs in the safe direction: theirs is *on field*, ours is FPL's team clean sheet.
A defender substituted at 70' whose team concedes at 85' earns a Fantrax clean
sheet and no FPL one — so our preview will **undercount** him, never overcount.
What 21 Aug still has to settle is only *when* they credit it, not what they
credit.

### The two answers Craig gave (13 Aug), which close both open questions

**Their totals move during a match — with one exception.** Fantrax does not
credit a **clean sheet until the final whistle**, while FPL credits one the
moment a player passes the hour with his goal intact. So a defender can keep a
clean sheet for eighty minutes and Fantrax will still show nothing for it, which
is the single place their live number is behind what the match has actually
produced.

That exception is the **only** scoring this app does, and it is a preview rather
than a score: `join/cleanSheets.ts` prices the clean sheets currently being kept,
using the league's own CS values read from `getLeagueInfo` (D 4, M 1, keeper 4,
forwards 0 — identical in both leagues today, and still read rather than
assumed). It counts **only fixtures in play**: the moment one finishes, Fantrax
credits it and it lands in their total, so counting a finished match would show
the same points twice. It is shown beside their number, never folded into it.

This is why `scoringSystem` is finally modelled after months as `unknown` — the
work item said "model it when a view first explains a number", and this is that
view. Only the flat `pointsN` values are parsed; the banded expressions
(`"range1|59|1|NULL$60|90|1|NULL"` for minutes, saves, goals conceded) are left
alone because nothing reads them.

**Lineups lock on a deadline, not per game** — 15 minutes before the first
fixture of the period. So the existing gate's shape is right: one lock for the
whole period, not a per-player one, and the per-player visibility work that a
gametime lock would have forced is not needed. The 15-minute offset is a
commissioner setting that `getLeagueInfo` does not publish; `rosterPeriods`
starts at the period boundary, which is kickoff, so the lock sits *before* the
data we hold and cannot be derived from it.

### What this means for the scoring engine

The plan approved on 13 Aug built one, on the stated premise that Fantrax would
not serve us league points without a cookie. **That premise is false.** Fantrax
serves its own per-player points, a category breakdown that sums exactly, live
team totals and its own projections — all publicly, all per period.

So we go back to the doctrine that was already written here: *Fantrax computes
the points and its numbers are authoritative; we read them.* Reading beats
computing on every axis that matters — the real league scores five categories FPL
does not publish (`GKP`, `KP`, `CLRA`, `DFP`, `MP`), so our own engine could only
ever have produced a systematically wrong number for defenders, midfielders and
keepers, and would have had to say so on every screen.

What is genuinely still unknown, and decides whether any fallback is needed at
all: **whether these numbers move during a match or only settle afterwards.**
Nothing can answer that before 21 Aug. Until then we read, we label the season
we are reading, and we build no engine.

## Sign-in, and where env files actually live (13 Aug 2026)

Sixteen friends, no accounts. Each manager gets one code; the app remembers which
team is his. Not a dropdown, because that identity is what will authorize
*editing* a lineup once the write surface exists.

- `npm run team-codes` issues one code per team and prints them once. **Only the
  HMACs go into the deployment**, as `TEAM_CODES`, so a leaked environment hands
  nobody a sign-in and a lost code is reissued rather than recovered.
- `SESSION_SECRET` does double duty: it keys those HMACs and signs the session
  cookie. Rotating it invalidates every code and every session at once, which is
  the correct blast radius and worth knowing before rotating it casually.
- The session cookie is `teamId.HMAC(teamId)`, httpOnly. Verified server-side,
  then checked against the league we currently serve — so a rehearsal session
  stops working the moment `FANTRAX_LEAGUE_ID` changes on 10 Oct, with no
  migration and no stale highlight. Forged signatures, unsigned values and signed
  ids for teams that do not exist were all tested against the running app.
- A wrong code fails slowly on purpose. There is no rate limiter in front of a
  serverless route and sixteen teams is a small haystack, so the defences are an
  eight-character code and a deliberate pause.
- **Reading stays open.** The code buys *being* a team — partisan ordering, and
  later lineup writes — never access. Nobody is locked out because a code went
  missing on ship day.

### The env file is not where you think

`next dev` runs with its project root at `apps/companion`, so it loads
**`apps/companion/.env.local`** and completely ignores the `.env.local` at the
repo root. The root one is still real and still used — the capture and probe
scripts read it with `node --env-file` — so both exist and they are not the same
file. This cost a debugging cycle: the codes verified correctly in Node and the
sign-in kept refusing, because the server had never seen `SESSION_SECRET`. Next
prints `- Environments: .env.local` on startup when it has loaded one; **absence
of that line is the tell.**

Ship-day consequence: `TEAM_CODES` and `SESSION_SECRET` join `FANTRAX_LEAGUE_ID`
as dashboard values that are invisible to git, so all three are numbered steps in
the runbook.

## CI, and the hosting decision (13 Aug 2026)

`verify.yml` runs the four green checks — test, typecheck, lint, build, cheapest
failure first — on `push` and `pull_request`, which unlike `schedule` fire from
any branch. The build step prerenders against live FPL and Fantrax, so a
provider shape change reddens CI before it reaches a phone; the cost is that a
provider blip can too.

**Known trap, accepted:** the daily capture pushes with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which by
design triggers no other workflows. Capture commits land on `main` with no
Verify run beside them. They touch only `data/snapshots/`, so this is
acceptable — but it is the same class of trap as the cron that had never fired:
automation that looks attached and is not.

**Hosting is live — Vercel, deployed 13 Aug 2026.** Production is
**`https://epl-draft-companion.vercel.app`**, building from `main`. Verified
from outside the same day: squads render players, which proves the bridge JSON
crossed the root-directory boundary — the failure the plan expected first — and
the optimizer serves PL portraits at ~25 KB from ~330 KB sources. One lag to
know rather than rediscover: production is `main`, so a feature branch's routes
404 there until it merges (`/matchup` did, on day one). The settings, recorded
for whoever revisits them:
Root Directory `apps/companion` with *include files outside the root directory*
left on, because `@epl/core` ships raw TypeScript via `transpilePackages` (so
install must run at the repo root) and `app/squad/league.ts` imports the bridge
JSON from `data/mappings/` outside the app directory — if the first build
breaks, expect it to break there. `FANTRAX_LEAGUE_ID` is set explicitly in the
dashboard (rehearsal `zbn1z3ukmsgb36sz` until 10 Oct), which makes the swap one
dashboard field — and being a dashboard value it is invisible to git, so it goes
in the ship-day runbook as a numbered step. `FANTRAX_COOKIE` is read by nothing
in the tree and must never reach Vercel. Expect a redeploy per day off the
capture commit; Ignored Build Step is the lever if that becomes noise.

### A push that deploys nothing — the commit author is a deploy credential

The merge of `feat/fantrax-league-layer` into `main` at 10:53 produced a
Production deployment that Vercel reported as **`failure — Deployment was
blocked`**, so the URL kept serving the 10:49 build and `/matchup` stayed a 404
on a commit that contains it. Nothing was wrong with the code: `verify.yml` was
green on the same commit, and the identical build passes locally.

**The cause was the commit's author email.** Vercel blocks a deployment whose
commit author cannot be matched to a GitHub account, and every commit here was
authored `craigdavidball14@gmail.com`, which is not on the `EH775` account. That
makes `user.email` a deploy credential in this repo, which is not how anyone
reads a git config. The tell is free and precise: GitHub's API returns
`author: null` for a commit it cannot attribute, so

```bash
gh api repos/EH775/epl-draft/commits/main -q '.author.login // "UNMATCHED"'
```

answers "will this deploy?" before the push does. Fixed by setting the author to
the account's own noreply address, **repo-locally** rather than globally —
`git config --local user.email 51231517+EH775@users.noreply.github.com` — so the
one repository whose pushes are deployments carries the identity that deploys
them, and Craig's other work is untouched. A fresh commit is required either
way: Vercel judges the commit it is given and does not retry an older one.

Blocked is not failed — the build never ran, which is why there was no build log
to read, only the deployment page.

Worth writing down beyond its own fix, because it is the **third** instance of
one pattern this month: the capture cron that had never fired, the capture
commits that trigger no workflow, and now a git push that deploys nothing. Every
one of them looks automated from the inside and is not. Green CI says the code
is good; it does not say the code shipped. **Before 10 Oct, the ship-day runbook
must check the deployed URL itself, not the commit that was pushed to it.**

## Questions

- **Does `?period=N` serve history once a period has completed?** Partially
  answered 12 Aug — accepted and echoed, but inert while every period is still
  in the future. Re-ask after period 1 ends 28 Aug.
- Does league scoring start at period 1 or period 6? `getLeagueInfo` numbers all
  38 periods from 21 Aug, but we draft at GW6. The rehearsal league's matchup
  schedule runs from period 1, so this is really a question about the real
  league's settings — recheck once its teams have joined.
- **Does the clean-sheet preview match what Fantrax settles at full time?**
  Half-answered: their threshold *is* 60 minutes and they publish it in a column
  tooltip (see above), so the rule is right. What is left is *when* they credit
  it, and the one real divergence — theirs is "on field", ours is FPL's team
  clean sheet, so a defender subbed off before his team concedes is one we
  undercount. Still first checkable on 21 Aug: watch one defender through a
  final whistle and see whether our +4 becomes their +4.
- **Does `getPlayerStats` serve real numbers once a game has been played?**
  Today it answers every year-to-date request with a projection, and there is no
  way to tell a refusal from an empty season while the season is empty. Nothing
  waits on the answer — the page prints the label Fantrax returns — but if it is
  still projecting on 22 Aug, the pool's points column has to come from the
  sixteen `getTeamRosterInfo` reads instead, which is a data-flow change and not
  a rewrite.
- What should `apps/lab` look like for the 27/28 platform prototype?

**Answered:** period↔gameweek alignment — kickoff, not deadline. Whether
`getMatchups` carries totals — it does not, and it is login-walled, so it is of
no use to us. What Fantrax data to replicate vs proxy — **replicate: their
points are public and authoritative, so we read them and compute nothing**, bar
the clean-sheet preview. Whether their numbers move live — **they do**, except
clean sheets. Whether lineups lock per game — **no**, one deadline 15 minutes
before the period's first fixture. And
why Vercel blocked the first production deployment: an unmatched commit author
email, not billing — see the hosting section.

## Work items

- [x] Settle the two conflicting fuzzy rows (Andrews, Koumas) and sign off the
      other eleven — all 13 `conflicting` rows now carry `auditedAt`. *Landed
      19 Aug 2026; see the identity bridge section above for the reasoning.*
- [x] Add `Ehor Yarmolyuk` to the alias file. *Landed 19 Aug 2026 — the ceiling
      put him in review, which is how he got written.*
- [x] Decide how the ~156 never-in-FPL players get recorded. `auditedAt` means a
      person looked, so a score threshold must never write it — a distinct,
      machine-set reason keeps "confirmed" separable from "assumed". *Landed
      19 Aug 2026: `unmappedBy`, and a ceiling on what the script may answer for.
      See the residue section above.*
- [ ] Read the 3 remaining review rows (`Fred Heath` and `Enzo Kana Biyik`, MUN;
      `Lucas Pitt`, LIV). All three look like academy players the metric found a
      stranger for, but only a person may write `unmappedBy: "manual"`.
- [x] Automate the capture (cron or CI) — manual runs will not survive October.
      Run `capture:status` as a **separate workflow on a different schedule**, so
      the job that might die is not the job responsible for noticing. *Landed
      6 Aug, but only became live on 12 Aug: workflows fire from the default
      branch and the branch had not merged, so the cron had never once run.
      Verified by dispatching it manually rather than waiting for 05:10.*
- [x] Capture the three `getTransactionDetailsHistory` views daily, and build the
      feed from them rather than from capture diffs (see 12 Aug notes). Bind to
      `cell.key`; the header names include a broken i18n placeholder. *Landed
      19 Aug 2026 — the capture and the mapper were already there; the paper was
      still reading one view of three, so no trade had ever reached it. See the
      ordering note above.*
- [x] Model `scoringSystem` when a view first explains a number — read from
      `getLeagueInfo`, never from a checked-in copy (§3). *Landed 13 Aug, and
      then largely superseded the same day: the view that explains a number is
      the player card, and it explains it with Fantrax's own category breakdown
      rather than with our rules. `ScoringRules` survives because the
      clean-sheet preview prices itself from it.*
- [ ] **21 Aug, or the first day of real data:** re-read `getPlayerStats` and see
      whether its year-to-date refusal was a refusal or an empty season. The
      Players column heading answers this on its own — if it still says "Fantrax
      projection" once a round has been played, it was a refusal.
- [ ] Design the cookie flow for the fxpa write surface.
- [ ] Re-run `npm run bridge` after rehearsal waiver churn; gate on zero
      rostered-but-unmapped.

**Done since:** rosters, standings, teams and matchups modelled against real
payloads; captures filed per league; period alignment settled and scripted; the
`CLAUDE.md` pool-count and `sportRadarId` corrections landed.

## Season log

- 2026-08-13 (evening): the app became the app in the vision. Six tabs
  (Gazetta, League, Squads, Live, Players, FPL), all fifteen on the pitch
  instead of eleven and a bench strip, and — the piece everything else was
  waiting on — it now knows whose team you are. Sign-in is one code per manager,
  HMACs only in the environment, signed httpOnly session, and reading stays open
  to everyone. Your head-to-head leads the live centre and sorts to the top of
  the matchups; your row is marked in the table. The Gazetta shipped its first
  edition off two readers that had sat unused in core for a week — the
  transaction feed and FPL's injury news — and Team of the Week names whose
  player it was and which manager benched him. The FPL tab landed small, as
  planned. Caching moved from pages to the shared provider reads, which is what
  made a cookie affordable.
- 2026-08-13: Craig's cookie went into `.env.local`, every fxpa method was
  probed twice, and the scoring engine died before it was written. Fantrax
  serves its own points publicly — typed team totals on `getLiveScoringStats`,
  per-player points and an exact category breakdown on `getTeamRosterInfo` —
  while the one login-walled method turned out to hold nothing but the schedule
  we already read. The head-to-head now shows their real numbers. Also today:
  the app grew its six-tab shape (League owns a prefix, /team became /squad, the
  tab bar became one component in two shapes, a Matchday section that exists
  only when there is football), the season's schedule landed as the first
  consumer of `periodGameweeks`, and both providers are asked politely now.
- 2026-08-13: The companion has somewhere to live. Craig ran the Vercel
  import in the evening: `https://epl-draft-companion.vercel.app`, root
  directory `apps/companion`, rehearsal league id set as a production env var.
  Verified from outside — the bridge crossed the boundary, portraits come back
  optimized, and `/matchup` 404s on production because `main` has not taken the
  branch yet, which is the merge's argument, not a bug.
- 2026-08-13: Head-to-head landed eight days before the league first needs it —
  `periodPairings` in core, `/matchup` under the League tab, and "vs" on every
  squad page. The probe that shaped it: `getMatchups` is login-walled, so the
  page shows pairings and countable events and no number it calls points. CI
  arrived the same day (`verify.yml`, four checks on every push); the Vercel
  deploy is decided but deliberately not executed — deferred to a day with eyes
  on it. Verified against both leagues: the rehearsal renders its pairings with
  the gate closed, the real league answers `NO_TEAMS` as a panel.
- 2026-08-12: Player profiles landed — one `getPlayerProfile` per tap from the
  pool, typed against a live probe. Refactor pass with it: the status strings, the
  violation check and the planner's move sheet each moved to the file that answers
  their own question, and the four routes that had each hand-rolled "a Fantrax
  refusal is a state, not a crash" now share one.
- 2026-08-12: The app got navigation and two more sections — `/players` (the pool
  as our league sees it) and `/standings` (Fantrax's table, never recomputed) —
  behind a four-tab bar. `violations()` landed with the planner as its consumer.
  Five empty states became one panel, which is what the rule of 2/3 asked for the
  moment the third appeared.
- 2026-08-12: Refactor pass over the day's work — five visibility exports down to
  one, the fxpa batch transport and its unused cookie parameter deleted, and
  SquadList's duplicate copy of the pitch order removed in favour of the one
  `positionDepth` core already owned. Lineup planner shipped behind a
  league-gated preview.
- 2026-08-12: Merged to `main` — the capture cron had never fired, because
  workflows only run from the default branch. Six days of history (7–11 Aug) are
  gone permanently. Dispatched the workflow by hand to prove it works rather
  than trusting 05:10. Craig executed the first rehearsal trade and free-agent
  claim, which settled the transactions design: the native feed wins, capture
  diffs corroborate. Lineup visibility gate shipped — squads all week, XI only
  once the period opens.
- 2026-08-05: Created `PLATFORM_NOTES.md` and improved `CLAUDE.md`.
- 2026-08-05: Probed Fantrax live and recorded the facts above. Added the
  read-only league layer, the dated snapshot capture, and the identity bridge
  (542/699 settled). Config module added; `npm run typecheck` made to pass for
  the first time.
- 2026-08-05: Removed position from the football layer. Added
  `MappedEntry.agreement` so the fuzzy audit can be ranked by risk rather than by
  a score that is always 100 — 13 of 66 rows need eyes, two of them genuinely.
  Established that the bridge covers 223 of the 224 players who can ever be
  rostered, which is the number that matters rather than 78%.
- 2026-08-06: The rehearsal league auto-drafted — 4 teams, 60 picks — and every
  read that had only ever returned an error or `[]` returned data. Captures are
  now filed per league with the pool outside them, and both leagues are captured
  on every run. Modelled rosters, standings, teams and matchups from real
  payloads; fixed `draftType` defaulting to `""` for a key the rehearsal league
  does not send. Settled the period↔gameweek question: aligned by **kickoff**, all
  38 periods and all 380 fixtures, with `npm run periods` re-checking against live
  FPL. The bridge resolved all 60 drafted players with zero misses.
