# Platform notes

This file is our living season log and platform journal.
Update it whenever we make architecture decisions, discover API quirks, or
capture season-specific tradeoffs.

## Purpose

- Track what the platform is doing now versus what Fantrax is doing.
- Record design decisions that matter for next season.
- Capture unresolved questions, blockers, and follow-up work.
- Keep a shared source of truth for engineering notes.

## Current season summary

- Start date: 5 Aug 2026.
- Season target: support the 16-user Fantrax league from GW6 onwards.
- A dummy league carries GW1–GW5. It is drafted early and deliberately small, so
  the roster, lineup and join surfaces get five gameweeks of real football to be
  refined against before the real league drafts. GW1 is not a ship date.
- Fantrax remains authoritative for live scoring and league state.
- We are building the platform layer separately so the UI and football data can
  survive provider changes.

## Current priorities

- Keep `packages/core` clean: adapters, maps, scoring, identity.
- Keep `apps/companion` focused on the live app experience.
- Keep `apps/lab` as the future 27/28 prototype.
- Avoid building a server-side Fantrax login unless the extension/cookie flow is
  solved.

## Known constraints

- Fantrax auth is gated by reCAPTCHA + 2FA and cannot be migrated to a standard
  password flow.
- FPL player `code` is stable; FPL player `id` is season-scoped.
- Fantrax sport code for EPL is `EPL`, not `SOCCER`.

## Verified Fantrax facts (probed live 5 Aug 2026)

League id `ayyoh3n2mr326v2o`. Everything below is from real responses, not docs.

**Errors arrive as HTTP 200.** The failure is in the body:
`{"error":{"onScreen":bool,"code":string,"message":string}}`. `res.ok` is useless
here — the FPL client's `if (!res.ok) throw` would sail straight past every one of
them. Codes seen so far: `WARNING`, `INVALID_LEAGUE_ID`, `NO_TEAMS`, `NO_LEAGUE`.
The vocabulary is undocumented and inconsistent (the same missing-leagueId
condition returns `WARNING` from some methods and `INVALID_LEAGUE_ID` from
others), so we branch on the envelope's presence, never on a specific code.

**The league is empty until the draft.** `getTeamRosters` answers `NO_TEAMS`,
`getStandings` is `[]`, `getDraftResults` is `{draftPicks: [], draftState:
"running"}`. Their element shapes had therefore never been observed and were
typed `unknown` rather than invented — until 6 Aug, below.

**`getLeagueInfo` is populated now**, and carries: 38 scoring and roster periods
aligned to FPL gameweeks (period 1 opens 21 Aug), roster limits 14 total / 11
active / 3 reserve with position caps G1 D5 M5 F3, snake draft, the full scoring
system, and a 699-entry `playerInfo` map. Timestamps carry a `-0400` (US Eastern)
offset while `startDate`/`endDate` are plain dates — do not mix them.

**`getPlayerIds?sport=EPL`** needs no leagueId and returns 759 entries (758 on
5 Aug — the pool moves), of which **60 are not players**: synthetic per-club
entities (`Tm`, `TmOF`, `TmG`) whose `fantraxId` contains `#`. Filter them out or
they reach the identity bridge and match a club by name. `rotowireId` is on 544
of the 699 real players (78%; the 71% figure that was in `CLAUDE.md` divided by
all 759 entries, team entities included). **`sportRadarId` does not appear on this
endpoint at all.**

**Club codes differ from FPL on exactly two of twenty:** Fantrax `BRF`/`NOT`
versus FPL `BRE`/`NFO`. Everything else matches.

## Verified Fantrax facts (probed live 6 Aug 2026, both leagues)

The rehearsal league `zbn1z3ukmsgb36sz` was auto-drafted this morning: 4 teams,
15 rounds, 60 picks. `getTeamRosters` and `getStandings` returned populated
payloads for the first time, so the three reads above stopped being wishes.

**`getTeamRosters` takes a `period` parameter and echoes it back.** Previously
unknown. Shape is `{period, rosters: {teamId: {teamName, salaryCap, rosterItems:
[{id, position, status}]}}}`, status `ACTIVE`/`RESERVE`. Note the shape was not
merely unmodelled before — it was typed `Record<string, unknown>`, i.e. guessed
wrong, which is `CODE_RULES.md`'s "raw.ts no longer mirrors reality" refactor
trigger.

**Field presence varies between leagues, not just between states.** On the same
day, from the same method: the real league's `getLeagueInfo` carries `draftType`
and `leagueHistoryId`, the rehearsal league's carries neither. That is why every
raw field is optional, and it caught a live §5 violation — `mapLeagueInfo` did
`draftType: raw.draftType ?? ""`, which now reports a draft type Fantrax never
gave. It is `string | null`.

**Roster limits differ by league** — 15 total / 11 active / 5 reserve in the
rehearsal league against 14 / 11 / 3 in the real one, same position caps
(G1 D5 M5 F3). Leaving them mismatched was right: rendering both correctly is the
10 Oct swap, tested continuously instead of discovered on the day.

**`playerInfo.status` is an ownership flag.** Exactly the 60 rostered players are
`T`, 638 are `FA`, one is `WW`. Stays a raw string — the vocabulary is theirs.

**Standings shape is known and every value is zero**, because nothing has been
played. `points` is a `"0-0-0"` win-loss-tie string, left unparsed: splitting it
would infer a format from an all-zero sample. `gamesBack` and `winPercentage` are
derived by them and not mapped.

**The bridge resolved all 60 drafted players** — 50 exact, 10 fuzzy, zero misses,
60 distinct FPL codes. The launch gate most likely to embarrass us passes on real
rosters, and the one-to-one guarantee holds on live data.

**Degradation states multiply.** In a one-team dummy league, draft picks arrive
with no `playerId` at all and the roster is `[]` rather than a `NO_TEAMS` error.
Draft picks also arrive unsorted, and in an auto-draft every pick's `time` is
identical.

### The period↔gameweek alignment, settled — and the test that misleads

This was an open question. It is answered, and the obvious way to check it gives
the wrong answer:

- By **FPL deadline**, the two calendars disagree everywhere. Each deadline lands
  one period early — period 1 holds gameweek 2's — and around the September break
  period 3 gets no gameweek while period 4 gets two.
- By **fixture kickoff**, all 38 periods contain exactly the identically numbered
  gameweek. All 380 fixtures, zero mismatches, in both leagues.

Fantrax's period boundary sits inside the 90-minute gap between FPL's deadline and
that gameweek's first kickoff, which is what puts the deadline on the wrong side
of it. **Kickoff is the alignment key.** `deadline_time` is the field anyone
reaches for first, so `calendar.test.ts` asserts the wrong answer too, by name.

Both leagues carry byte-identical `scoringPeriods` today, but that is default
settings rather than a rule, so `npm run periods` checks each league separately
against live FPL. Postponements are the known future divergence: FPL keeps a
rearranged fixture in its original `event`, Fantrax scores it in the period
actually played.

**Position is league state, not football truth.** The commissioner can change a
player's position whenever they like, and `eligiblePos` is multi-valued (`"F,M"`,
`"M,D"` — 51 players today). It is a display hint and never a join key. The
player universe is mutable too: Fantrax carries academy players FPL has never
listed (699 real players against FPL's 570 non-manager elements), so `unmapped` is
a correct and permanent state for some players rather than a matching failure.

## Decisions

- **FPL has hard rules; custom rules are Fantrax's product.** This is *why* the
  two layers are separate, and it is sharper than "different providers". FPL
  models a game whose rules are fixed for everyone, so they can be constants. A
  Fantrax league models a game whose rules are the thing being sold: roster limits
  and position caps, the position vocabulary itself, the scoring system, the
  period calendar, the lineup deadline, team count, the matchup schedule, draft
  type, season bounds. **All of it is read from `getLeagueInfo`** — never assumed,
  never hardcoded, never inferred from the football layer. The two layers differ
  in epistemics, not just in content. `RosterLimits` is the precedent to copy.
- **The calendar is the second seam between the layers.** "They meet only through
  player identity" was true until periods needed aligning to gameweeks. The rule
  is now: the league layer may be *told* about the football calendar as plain
  data, but may never import the football adapter, and football may never import
  the league. `league/calendar.ts` declares its own `GameweekKickoff` rather than
  importing `Fixture`, the same move `identity/candidates.ts` makes with
  `FplCandidate`. A script does the wiring.
- **Snapshots are filed per league, and the pool is filed outside them.**
  `getPlayerIds` takes no leagueId and returns byte-identical answers for every
  league, so filing it under one would force `build-bridge.ts` to choose
  arbitrarily between two copies — and that arbitrary choice is the tell. It also
  keeps ~104 KB/day of duplication out of git.
- **Position left the football layer.** `FootballPlayer` no longer carries one.
  FPL's `element_type` is FPL's own fantasy classification, not a property of the
  footballer — Fantrax files the same player differently and lets them hold
  several positions at once. Neither provider is describing the real world, so a
  single `Position` in a layer that claims to be provider-neutral was a league
  concept wearing football clothes. Positions now exist only in the league layer,
  as `eligiblePositions`. Nothing in the UI read it, so there was no call site to
  migrate, and `element_type` stays in `fpl/raw.ts`, which mirrors the wire
  format whether or not we consume a field.
- **No scoring engine this season.** Fantrax computes the points and its numbers
  are authoritative; we read them. The full `scoringSystem` is captured but not
  modelled. Minor exceptions may come later, deliberately.
- **No write surface yet.** The fxpa methods (`confirmOrExecuteTeamRosterChanges`
  for lineups, `confirmOrExecutePlayerPickerChanges` for waivers) need a member's
  browser session cookie. Deferred to September. Note that before the draft there
  are no rosters to change, so there is nothing to test against either.
- **`data/` is checked into git.** The snapshots and the identity bridge are the
  season's permanent record; git is both audit trail and backup.
- **Capture starts now, not at the draft.** Roster transitions cannot be
  backfilled from anywhere — see below.

## Why the capture cannot wait

Fantrax serves current state only. It will not tell us in March who was benched in
October, and no archive holds our league: it sits behind a league id nothing
crawls. Any longitudinal question — form over time, who has been dropped by whom,
the FM-style player narratives we want in 27/28 — is answerable only from a record
we wrote ourselves, as it happened.

The sibling project (`~/ai-carling-premiership`) had exactly this and its per-GW
capture died silently at GW35. It survived only because FPL's bootstrap is a public
URL the Internet Archive happens to crawl monthly. We have no such luck, so the
failure mode to design against is silence, not error: `npm run capture:status`
reports the age of the last capture and exits non-zero when overdue.

Cadence is weekly until a league drafts and daily after, and both are per league:
the rehearsal league crossed that line on 6 Aug, the real one crosses it on
10 Oct, so `capture:status` reports each separately. One combined answer would
hide whichever of them stopped. Known blind spot: at daily granularity a player
added and dropped the same day is invisible. Revisit once the draft shows how much
same-day churn there actually is.

## Identity bridge

`data/mappings/fantrax.json`, generated by `npm run bridge`, audited by hand.
First run: **542 of 699 settled** — 474 exact, 66 fuzzy, 2 by curated alias.

The ladder is exact → alias → fuzzy, two passes per club, one-to-one. Exact
matches claim their FPL player before fuzzy matching can compete for them, and a
fuzzy win must clear 88, beat the runner-up by 3, and — where the win came from
one name containing the other — agree on the surname. That last guard is load
bearing: `token_set_ratio` scores containment at 100, so "Gabriel" ties perfectly
with both Arsenal's Gabriel and Gabriel Jesus.

Three bugs worth remembering, all found by running against the real pool rather
than by the test suite:

1. **The surname guard read the wrong end of the name.** Fantrax writes
   surname-first, so the last token of its raw form is the *given* name. The guard
   was asking whether FPL's player is called "Danny" and rejecting Daniel Ballard.
   Every diminutive failed this way — Josh/Joshua, Ben/Benjamin — while looking
   like a careful refusal. It reads the reading-order form now.
2. **Apostrophes.** Fantrax writes `OBrien`, FPL writes `O'Brien`. Normalising the
   apostrophe to a space split one token into two sharing nothing with the other,
   dropping completely unambiguous names below threshold. Deleted, not spaced.
3. **Claimed codes did not survive a re-run.** The one-to-one guard was per-run,
   so a code won on run one was free again on run two: Jack Clarke matched, then
   Harry Clarke took his code. Three FPL players ended up with two claimants. The
   matcher is now seeded from the existing bridge.

Re-runs are additive only. Audited entries and confirmed-`unmapped` players are
never revised by the script — the pool mutates constantly, and a run that quietly
overwrote a human decision would be untrustworthy exactly where it was most
carefully made.

### Ranking the audit

`confidence` cannot rank it: every fuzzy row scores 100, because
`token_set_ratio` saturates whenever one name's tokens contain the other's.
`MappedEntry.agreement` is the second signal — it compares the two *full* names
and reports `identical`, `contained` or `conflicting`. Full names only: FPL
publishes a bare surname as a name variant, so scoring against variants makes
every genuine conflict read as containment.

That splits the 66 fuzzy rows **53 `contained` / 13 `conflicting`**. Eleven of the
thirteen are plainly one player written two ways (Danny/Daniel Ballard,
Kostas/Konstantinos Tsimikas, Djordje/Đorđe Petrović — Serbian `Đ` transliterates
to `Dj` in one feed and folds to `d` in ours). Two cannot be settled from the
payloads at all, because the feeds agree on club *and* position:

- `Andrews, Keith` → `Kaine Andrews` (COV)
- `Koumas, Louie` → `Lewis Koumas` (LIV)

Adding the field changed no assignment: regenerating from an empty bridge
reproduced the same 542 rows with zero `fplCode` reassignments.

### What the coverage number means

78% understates it badly. Roster limits are 14 players across 16 teams, so **224
of the 699 will ever be rostered**. Against FPL's top 224 by price the bridge
covers 223 — and the miss, Nicolas Jackson, is absent from Fantrax's pool
entirely rather than unmatched. The 157 in review are overwhelmingly academy
players nobody will draft: 156 of them score below 60 against their best
candidate, which is noise. The single real match in that pile is `Ehor Yarmolyuk`
→ `Yehor Yarmoliuk` at 72, a Ukrainian transliteration that belongs in the alias
file.

**Outstanding:** nothing in the bridge is human-audited yet — `auditedAt` is unset
on all 542 rows.

## Recorded rule exceptions

Each entry is a deliberate departure from `CODE_RULES.md`, recorded in the commit
that made it.

### `revalidate` literal in `apps/companion/app/page.tsx` (§3, no hardcoding)

Next requires a route segment's `export const revalidate` to be a statically
analysable literal, so it cannot be imported from `packages/core/src/config.ts`.
The value intentionally duplicates `REVALIDATE.live`. Both must change together;
a comment at each site says so.

### Next's `next.revalidate` inside `packages/core` (§5) — RESOLVED, removed

Both provider clients used to pass Next's `next: { revalidate }` extension to
`fetch`, which §5 forbids inside core. Resolved by deleting it rather than by
typing around it: the clients now use plain `fetch` with standard options only,
and freshness is the route's business via each segment's `revalidate`.

The cost is real and accepted: per-endpoint TTLs are gone, so a page render
refetches bootstrap (1.3 MB) rather than reusing a data-cache entry. FPL's API is
public and unmetered, and a rules-clean core is worth more than the bytes.

Follow-up worth knowing about: `/gw/[gameweek]` builds as a dynamic route, so it
re-renders per request instead of being served from the full route cache. That
was masked before by fetch-level caching. Not worth acting on until the app is
actually in front of people after the draft — noted so it is a decision rather
than a surprise.

Also note: `npm run typecheck` had never passed before this — the failure was
invisible because `CLAUDE.md`'s verify section lists only `npm test` and
`npm run build`. Both now gate every commit alongside typecheck.

### `process.env` inside `packages/core/src/config.ts` (§5, purity at the core)

`FANTRAX_LEAGUE_ID` reads the environment, defaulting to the rehearsal league.
Setting that variable is the entire 10 Oct swap, and it is what lets CI point a
build at the real (empty) league today and watch every view meet its empty states.

§5's ban on environment reads names mappers, scoring and engines — the places
where an unseen `process.env` makes behaviour untestable. A config module is the
one place the read is legible, and §3 explicitly offers "one config module or
environment" as the home for a league id.

Core's tsconfig still omits node types, so nothing in `packages/core` can reach
for `fs`. The single global is declared locally in `config.ts` rather than opening
that door for one string.

### New dependency: `tsx` (§2, every dependency is a recorded decision)

Dev-only, never shipped. The capture and bridge runners import `@epl/core`, whose
relative imports are extensionless, which Node's native type-stripping will not
resolve. `tsx` is the smallest thing that runs them unchanged.

Scripts transpile to CJS (the root package has no `"type": "module"`), so they
cannot use top-level `await` — each wraps its body in `main()` and calls it
without awaiting, so a rejection crashes the run loudly instead of being softened.

## Questions

- **Does `?period=N` on `getTeamRosters` return a past roster or a projection?**
  Untestable until a transaction exists to tell the two apart. The answer decides
  whether roster history is backfillable, and therefore how strong the "capture
  cannot wait" doctrine really is. Ask again after the first rehearsal waiver
  move (21 Aug or later).
- Does league scoring start at period 1 or period 6? `getLeagueInfo` numbers all
  38 periods from 21 Aug, but we draft at GW6. The rehearsal league's matchup
  schedule runs from period 1, so this is really a question about the real
  league's settings — recheck once its teams have joined.
- What Fantrax data should we replicate vs proxy?
- What should `apps/lab` look like for the 27/28 platform prototype?

**Answered:** period↔gameweek alignment — see above. Kickoff, not deadline.

## Work items

- [ ] Settle the two conflicting fuzzy rows (Andrews, Koumas), sign off the other
      eleven, and add `Ehor Yarmolyuk` to the alias file. Less optional than it
      looks now: a players tab puts all 699 on screen and the FPL tab reads the
      bridge backwards, so both make the noise visible.
- [ ] Decide how the ~156 never-in-FPL players get recorded. `auditedAt` means a
      person looked, so a score threshold must never write it — a distinct,
      machine-set reason keeps "confirmed" separable from "assumed".
- [ ] Automate the capture (cron or CI) — manual runs will not survive October.
      Run `capture:status` as a **separate workflow on a different schedule**, so
      the job that might die is not the job responsible for noticing.
- [ ] Model `scoringSystem` when a view first explains a number — read from
      `getLeagueInfo`, never from a checked-in copy (§3).
- [ ] Design the cookie flow for the fxpa write surface.
- [ ] Re-run `npm run bridge` after rehearsal waiver churn; gate on zero
      rostered-but-unmapped.

**Done since:** rosters, standings, teams and matchups modelled against real
payloads; captures filed per league; period alignment settled and scripted; the
`CLAUDE.md` pool-count and `sportRadarId` corrections landed.

## Season log

- 2026-08-05: Created `PLATFORM_NOTES.md` and improved `CLAUDE.md`.
- 2026-08-05: Probed Fantrax live and recorded the facts above. Added the
  read-only league layer, the dated snapshot capture, and the identity bridge
  (542/699 settled). Config module added; `npm run typecheck` made to pass for
  the first time.
- 2026-08-05: Removed position from the football layer. Added
  `MappedEntry.agreement` so the fuzzy audit can be ranked by risk rather than by
  a score that is always 100 — 13 of 66 rows need eyes, two of them genuinely.
  Established that the bridge covers 223 of the 224 players who can ever be
  rostered, which is the number that matters rather than 78%.
- 2026-08-06: The rehearsal league auto-drafted — 4 teams, 60 picks — and every
  read that had only ever returned an error or `[]` returned data. Captures are
  now filed per league with the pool outside them, and both leagues are captured
  on every run. Modelled rosters, standings, teams and matchups from real
  payloads; fixed `draftType` defaulting to `""` for a key the rehearsal league
  does not send. Settled the period↔gameweek question: aligned by **kickoff**, all
  38 periods and all 380 fixtures, with `npm run periods` re-checking against live
  FPL. The bridge resolved all 60 drafted players with zero misses.
